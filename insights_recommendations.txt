Customer Segmentation and Credit Risk Analysis Report
----------------------------------------------------

1. Customer Segmentation:
We identified 4 distinct customer segments based on Balance and Credit Limit.
Clusters were created using K-Means clustering, revealing varied customer profiles.

2. Credit Risk Prediction:
Confusion Matrix:
[[680 631]
 [651 629]]

3. Recommendations:
Focus on retaining high-risk customers identified by the model. Use targeted strategies to minimize churn among these high-risk groups.
Implement personalized offers and incentives tailored to different customer segments.
Consider further segmentation based on additional features for more precise targeting and strategy development.
Regularly update the models with new data to ensure accuracy and adapt to evolving customer behaviors.
Investigate fraud risk patterns within clusters to tailor risk management strategies effectively.
